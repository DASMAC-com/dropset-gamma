# `pr-title-description`

Write (or update) the title and description
for the pull request on the current branch.

## Steps

1. Identify the current branch and its PR
   (if one exists) using
   `gh pr list --head <branch>`.

1. Get the full diff against `main`:
   `git diff main..HEAD` and
   `git log main..HEAD --oneline`.

1. Fetch the body of the 3 most recent merged
   PRs to match their style:

   ```sh
   gh pr list --state merged --limit 3 \
     --json number,title,body
   ```

1. Write the PR title using the **Semantic PR /
   Conventional Commits** format:

   ```txt
   <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
   ```

   - **type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`,
     `test`, `docs`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`,
     `build`, or `style`.
   - **scope**: the ticket ID extracted from the
     branch name (e.g. `ENG-254`). If the branch
     has no ticket ID, use the most relevant
     module or area instead.
   - **short summary**: imperative voice (as if
     telling the repo what to do), capitalize the
     first word, no trailing period.

   Examples:

   - `feat(ENG-123): Add frame offset scaffolding and asm config sourcing`
   - `fix(ENG-456): Correct off-by-one in order matching`
   - `docs(ENG-789): Add algorithm index page`

1. Write a concise PR description that mirrors
   the format and tone of those recent PRs.
   Typically this means a `# Changes` section
   with a numbered list. Add a `# Background`
   section only if the changes need non-obvious
   context.

1. If a PR already exists for the branch, update
   it with `gh pr edit <number> --body "..."`.
   If the PR is in draft mode, also mark it ready
   for review with `gh pr ready <number>`.
   Otherwise, report the description so the user
   can create the PR.

1. Show the user the PR URL when done.
